update the BeerController to use DTOs.  In the package `domain`, create a BeerDto with the same properties as the Beer Entity.  The DTO should use 
lombok annotations including Builder.  Create a Mapstruct mapper to convert to and from the DTO.  Mappers should go into the `mappers` package.  When converting
from a DTO to the JPA entity, ignore the properties id, createdDate and updateDate.  Update the service layer to accept DTO objects and to use the Mapstruct
mapper for type conversions.  Update the controller methods to use the new DTO.  Update the test methods to use DTOs where appropriate.
