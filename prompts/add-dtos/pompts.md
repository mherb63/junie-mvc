Analyze the file `prompts/add-dtos/requirements-draft.md` and inspect the project.  Improve and rewrite the requirements 
to a new file named `prompts/add-dtos/requirements.md`

-------------------------------------------------------

Analyze the `prompts/add-dtos/requirements.md` and create a detailed plan for the implementation of adding 
DTOs for the Beer entity to this project.  Write the plan to `prompts/add-dtos/plan.md`

-------------------------------------------------------

Create a detailed enumerated task list according to the suggested enhancements found in `prompts/add-dtos/plan.md`
Task items should have a placeholder [ ] for marking as done [x] upon task completion.
Write the task list to `prompts/add-dtos/tasks.md`

-------------------------------------------------------

Complete the task list `prompts/add-dtos/tasks.md`.  Inspect the requirements.md and plan.md.  Implement
the tasks in the task list.  Focus on completing the tasks in order. Mark each task as completed as it is 
done by using [x].  As each task is completed, it is very important to update the task list by marking the
task as done with a [x].
